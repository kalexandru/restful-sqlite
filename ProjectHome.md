"SQLitebot" is a RESTful HTTP interface to SQLite databases. It supports SELECT, INSERT, REPLACE, UPDATE, and DELETE methods. Moving forward with this project, I plan on implementing the following features:

  * Filtering and sorting

And possibly later:
  * Metadata provided in table headers for GET and HEAD methods
  * Asynchronous streaming method for updates to a table
  * Authentication
